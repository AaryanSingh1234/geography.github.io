    <h1>How much of the Amazon Rainforest has been destroyed?</h1>
    <p>By the year 2018, 17% of the Amazon forest was reported as having been lost. <br>  Deforestation rates in the Amazon peaked in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with some years seeing 10,000 square miles razed within 12 month periods. <br>  Because the Amazon Rainforest is enduring a near-constant onslaught from ranchers, farmers, loggers, and land-grabbers, itâ€™s impossible to pin down a precise figure of just how much has been lost to date. In 2019 the National Institute for Space Research (NISR) revealed that 3,769 square miles were destroyed during a 12 month period, marking a 30 percent increase during the previous yearlong period. During the first three months of 2020 alone, NISR observed just over 300 square miles of forest were destroyed.  <br> These figures are up over 50 percent from the same time the year previous. According to the watchdog organization Imazon, deforestation exploded by 279 percent in March 2020, as compared with last year. </p>
