    <h1>AMAZON DESTRUCTION</h1>
    <p>Since 1978 about one million square kilometers of Amazon rainforest have been destroyed across Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana. Why is Earth's largest rainforest being destroyed? <br>  For most of human history, deforestation in the Amazon was primarily the product of subsistence farmers who cut down trees to produce crops for their families and local consumption. <br> But in the later part of the 20th century, that began to change, with an increasing proportion of deforestation driven by industrial activities and large-scale agriculture. <br> By the 2000s more than three-quarters of forest clearing in the Amazon was for cattle-ranching.</p>

    <p>Tropical forests such as those in the Amazon basin and Congo Basin are particularly critical to climate efforts, because they store the most carbon.  <br> They are mainly hardwood and have no dormant period.  <br> Tropical forests are also key for biodiversity: <br>  They are home to 90% of the worldâ€™s species, <br> including iconic species under threat such as chimps, gorillas, forest elephants and orangutans</p>
